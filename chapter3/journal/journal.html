    <h1>Sefway'n USA</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: walla walla, Why, AZ
        and Truth or Consequences, NM.

        I saw some Burma shave style signs on the side of the road today:

    <blockquote>
        "passing cars. When you can't see, May get
        you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everthing packed and ready to go. Beacause I'm on a
        segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell Phone, Ipod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the
        essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
